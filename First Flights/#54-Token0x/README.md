## About the Project

Token-0x, A secure and cheap base ERC20 implementation, which follows the ERC20 standard. Token-0x has implemented all the necessary functions required to be a compliant ERC20 token but in different way. Token-0x achieves the secure and cheap operations by using a combination of Solidity and Yul in the base implementation. User can use it as ERC20 token like openzeppelin implementation.
