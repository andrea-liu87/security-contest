# Overview

The WERC7575 smart contract system is the **blockchain settlement layer** within a **multi-tier telecom wholesale voice traffic settlement ecosystem**. It works in conjunction with off-chain platforms (COMMTRADE and WRAPX) and telecom OSS/BSS systems to enable efficient, transparent settlement of inter-carrier voice traffic transactions.

## Result

# Additional context

## Areas of concern (where to focus for bugs)
  1. Batch Settlement Netting (WERC7575ShareToken.batchTransfers) - Validator-controlled, complex netting logic, zero-sum invariant validation, potential for state corruption
  2. Role Access Control - Five distinct roles (Owner, Validator, KYC Admin, Revenue Admin, Investment Manager) with independent permissions; risk of single-point-of-failure key compromise
  3. Reentrancy in Async Flows - External calls in deposit/redeem/investment functions with nonReentrant guards; validate CEI pattern throughout
  4. Dual Allowance Model - Non-standard ERC20 requiring self-allowance + caller allowance; validate both checks are enforced in transfer/transferFrom
  5. Reserved Asset Accounting - Ensure pending/claimable/invested assets are correctly calculated and don't overlap; verify investment layer can't over-allocate
  6. Async State Transitions - Request→Fulfill→Claim flow with cancelations; validate no state-skipping, double-claiming, or permanent blocking
  7. Permit Signature Validation - EIP-712 replay protection, nonce tracking, chain ID inclusion; validate validator signature authenticity
  8. Upgrade Safety - ERC-7201 namespaced storage, gap arrays, no storage reordering; validate upgrade pattern prevents storage collision

## Main invariants

### Settlement Layer

  1. sum(balances) == totalSupply - Token supply conservation
  2. batchTransfers: sum(balance changes) == 0 - Zero-sum settlement
  3. transfer requires self-allowance[user] - Permit enforcement
  4. transferFrom requires both allowances - Dual authorization
  5. Only KYC-verified addresses can receive/hold shares
  6. assetToVault[asset] ↔ vaultToAsset[vault] - One-to-one mapping
  7. Only registered vaults can mint/burn

### Investment Layer

  8. Deposit/Redeem: Pending → Claimable → Claimed (no skipping)
  9. investedAssets + reservedAssets ≤ totalAssets - Reserved protection
  10. convertToShares(convertToAssets(x)) ≈ x - Rounding accuracy

### Global 

  11. No role escalation - access control boundaries enforced
  12. No fund theft - no double-claims, no reentrancy, no bypass


## All trusted roles in the protocol

The roles of the system are as follows:

- Owners
- Validators
- KYC Administrators
- Revenue Administrators
- Investment Managers 

Their privileges are documented in the known issues section of the contest.

## Running tests

### Prerequisites

The repository utilizes the `foundry` (`forge`) toolkit to compile its contracts, and contains several dependencies through `foundry` that will be automatically installed whenever a `forge` command is issued.

The compilation instructions were evaluated with the following toolkit versions:

- forge: `1.4.4-stable`

### Building

The traditional `forge` build command will install the relevant dependencies and build the project:

```sh
forge build
```

### Tests

The following command can be issued to execute all tests within the repository:

```sh
forge test
```

### Submission PoCs

The scope of the audit contest involves multiple EIP-7575 style contracts of varying complexity.

Wardens are instructed to utilize the respective test suite of the project to illustrate the vulnerabilities they identify, should they be constrained to a single file. A `AuditReproductionTest` also exists in the test suite that contains a comprehensive deployment that wardens can utilize.

If a custom configuration is desired, wardens are advised to create their own PoC file that should be executable within the `test` subfolder of this contest.

All PoCs must adhere to the following guidelines:

- The PoC should execute successfully
- The PoC must not mock any contract-initiated calls
- The PoC must not utilize any mock contracts in place of actual in-scope implementations
